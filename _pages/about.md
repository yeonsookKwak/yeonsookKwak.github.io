I am currently working as a data analyst in healthcare industry. I lived in Seoul, Korea. I took math&stat courses, machine learning, deep learning, computational science, and reinforcement learning, which gave me a logic-based thinking structure. And I graduated in 2024. My master thesis focuses on state detection on likelihoods especially wearable device records. Especially My master work centered on developing and rigorously testing statistical methods. 

Previously, I have worked in both a range of animal disease and interior arrangements, including clustering methods, bayesian models, early alert prediction on time-series data, high-dimensional data, and NLP usage for news report alert and interior platform categorizing. For more details on my current and past journey, please visit my [projects](/projects/) page.
