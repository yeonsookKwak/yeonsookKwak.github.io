This is a korea government research project and collaborated with Gangwon university, in kware,Inc. Especially I responsible data related part. 

#### Achieve clustering not possible with SQL queries 
<ul>
    <li>STEP1 : Partitioning time dependencies into accelerations </li>
    <li>STEP2 : Clustering based on location and density again based on STEP1</li>
</ul>
<hr>
The significance of this method is that it presents a way to link coordinate data (via GPS) over time without using panels, and it increases the computational efficiency in a simple way for visualization. 
The model is being web-serviced by the company by modularizing the API. Contributed clustering model methodology to korea academic journals. [paper](https://doi.org/10.13041/jpvm.2020.44.4.193)
