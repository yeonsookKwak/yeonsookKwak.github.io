This is a collaborated work with heedong Yun in Kware,Inc.
The pupose of this project is to build the module that leverages pattern-rich natual language data to quickly alert about animal disease risks.
In this project, we exploit Naive bayes classifier model and BERT NER extracter model.
- Build a pipeline for collecting, processing, and storing real-time sensor data
- Extracts required word which are contains Organization (ORG), Date (DATE), Disease (DISEASE), Location (LOC)
- Reuter animal disease new report and Korea ministry of Environment report applied 
Finally, we are extending to ensemble models that keep score values in line with the rules agreed upon by the stakeholders.
